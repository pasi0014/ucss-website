      "The Ottawa community celebrated the Festival of Carols and Shchedrivkas this Christmas with great pomp and grandeur. Various choirs and a children's group led by Mr. Oleksiy Fischuk greeted guests in the packed hall of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. However, it was the powerful performance by the student choir of the University of Ottawa under the direction of Maestro Laurentiy Ivashka that left the most profound impression on everyone What made their efforts truly remarkable was the fact that not a single performer of these famous Ukrainian carols spoke the Ukrainian language in their daily life. Rather, they were inspired by the enchanting melodies of the music they performed, and the audience was captivated by the sincere and genuine tone of their flawless performance. The volunteers of the Ukrainian Social Services in our city treated guests to incredibly delicious treats, making the festival an even more memorable experience. Grateful thanks were extended to everyone who contributed to the organization and execution of this highly anticipated carol festival, especially to the esteemed Ms. Jane Colby. Our culture is rich and vibrant, and we are delighted to enrich the community in which we live with it. We are also thankful to Rogers TV, who broadcasted the entire event on channel 22, allowing even more people to enjoy this wonderful celebration of music and culture.",
