      "The Ottawa community celebrated the Festival of Carols and Shchedrivkas this Christmas with great pomp and grandeur. Various choirs and a children's group led by Mr. Oleksiy Fischuk greeted guests in the packed hall of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. However, it was the powerful performance by the student choir of the University of Ottawa under the direction of Maestro Laurentiy Ivashka that left the most profound impression on everyone What made their efforts truly remarkable was the fact that not a single performer of these famous Ukrainian carols spoke the Ukrainian language in their daily life. Rather, they were inspired by the enchanting melodies of the music they performed, and the audience was captivated by the sincere and genuine tone of their flawless performance. The volunteers of the Ukrainian Social Services in our city treated guests to incredibly delicious treats, making the festival an even more memorable experience. Grateful thanks were extended to everyone who contributed to the organization and execution of this highly anticipated carol festival, especially to the esteemed Ms. Jane Colby. Our culture is rich and vibrant, and we are delighted to enrich the community in which we live with it. We are also thankful to Rogers TV, who broadcasted the entire event on channel 22, allowing even more people to enjoy this wonderful celebration of music and culture.",

      "For many Ukrainians, volunteering has become a way of life since 2014. For Ukrainian-Canadians, it has always been a good habit. And for my relatives, Aunt Tamara and Uncle Ivan, it's just a constant need. They live by the principle: wake up and ask yourself what you have done for Ukraine and Ukrainians today? So when the opportunity arose to organize a dragon boat event for newly arrived children, they left everything and enthusiastically set out to realize this wonderful idea. And in place of a dull, cold morning, a sunny and bright day with new unforgettable emotions arrived. Some took an oar in their hands for the first time, while others had recent experience with rowing in a summer camp. But everyone wanted to catch the rhythm of the dragon boat and feel each other! My wonderful Tamara Rudenko-Kharalambi and Ivan Kharalambi (who, by the way, is a professional athlete and Olympian) helped with this the most. Also joining the team of coaches was Oleksiy Morgun, the head of the junior commission of the EDBF. With such mentors, not only children but also parents got into the boats. And it's still not clear who enjoyed it more). We all rowed diligently, so the ordered pizza and sweets (thanks to Maryna Popovych and Mykhailo and Natalia Ryndzaki) tasted very, very good!!! And for a moment, it seemed like we were back at summer camp and it was time to prepare something for the kids' dinner))",
