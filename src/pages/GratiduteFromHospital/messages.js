        soldiers, medics and volunteers of the Odesa Military
        Medical Clinical Center of the Southern Region to the
        Ukrainian-Canadian Social Service in Ottawa, in particular
        to the head of the Ottawa branch, Maryna Popovych, for
        recently sending us 9 boxes of various medical consumables
        - devices for the resuscitation and operating unit etc.
        Every day we collect various necessary items and deliver
        them not only to our hospital, but also to mobile
        hospitals and units operating in various hot areas of the front 
        We meet the wounded, visit them, work psychologically, see them off.
        Currently, we are well supplied with "simple things",
        but there are valuable substitutes for VAC devices,
        optics for the laparoscopic device and other "difficult
        things" that turned out to be especially necessary and
        made the doctors very happy. THANK YOU VERY MUCH!! THANK
        YOU for tireless souls, hearts, hands and considerable
        funds, for DEEDS of LOVE for our Motherland! TOGETHER -
        WE WILL WIN AND REBUILD OUR UKRAINE! TOGETHER WE ARE
        STRENGTH!"`,
